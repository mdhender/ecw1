# Units Reference

Technical description of every unit in Epimethean Challenge: its category,
mass, volume, build inputs, operational requirements, and per-turn output.
Units are the components installed inside Entities (Ships and Colonies).

> **⚠️ Work in progress.** This reference is under active development. Some
> values are provisional (`TBD`), and unit statistics are being reconciled
> against the current engine. Figures may change.

> **⚠️ Spies and Special Agents.**
> These may be a single Cadre.
> The rules allow SPY units to perform multiple missions, some of which seem to overlap with SPAG.

## 1. Categories

Every unit belongs to one **Category** (the unit's `Class`). The table below
summarizes the categories; the [full unit table](#3-units) lists each unit's
statistics.

## 2. Conventions

Values that scale with a unit's Tech Level are written as expressions in `TL`
(for example `4 × TL`, `TL + 6`, `10 × TL^2`).

| Column                           | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **Category**                     | The unit's `Class` (see [§1](#1-categories)).                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Assembled?**                   | `yes` if the unit must be assembled before it operates.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Mass (MU)**                    | Mass in Mass Units.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Volume (VU)**                  | Assembled (operational) volume in Volume Units.                                                                                                                                                |
| **Volume Stowed (VU)**           | Dis-assembled (storage) volume; `—` for units that cannot be stowed (population and cadre).                                                                                                    |
| **Metals / Non-Metals to Build** | Metallics (`METL`) and Non-Metallics (`NMTL`) consumed to manufacture the unit. `N/A` for units that are not manufactured (resources, food, population, cadre); `TBD` where not yet specified. |
| **Operational Requirements**     | Labor, fuel, power, or other units needed to operate the unit each turn; `N/A` if none.                                                                                                        |

Abbreviations: **TL** = Tech Level (integer 0–10) · **MU** = Mass Unit · **VU** = Volume Unit · **TBD** = not yet specified.

**Stowability.** Every unit except Population and Cadre can be stowed; each such
unit lists its dis-assembled storage volume in the **Volume Stowed** column.
Population and Cadre can never be stowed — they show `—` and are always carried at
their full 1 VU. Units that must be assembled to operate (**Assembled?** = `yes`)
are stowed while unassembled and, like all stowable units, must be in the stowed
(unassembled) state to be transferred.
